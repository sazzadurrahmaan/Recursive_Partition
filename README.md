# Recursive Partition README
  This project implements a responsive layout builder where you can partition a space recursively by splitting it either vertically or horizontally. Each partition is randomly colored, and 
  you can further split or remove partitions. The partitions are resizable and can snap to specific ratios.

# Features
   Tile Rendering: Render a tile for each letter of the alphabet (A to Z) within a container or grid layout.
   Click Interaction: When a tile is clicked, append the corresponding letter to a string displayed in an HTML element with the ID outputString.
   Consecutive Letter Replacement: If three consecutive letters in the outputString are the same, replace them with an underscore (_). If more than three consecutive letters are the 
    same, 
   replace them with the appropriate number of underscores.
   Validation: Ensures that the solution meets the specified requirements.
